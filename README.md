# eda-diagnosing-diabetes
This project is an exercise from Codecademy's Data Science Foundations II | Exploratory Data Analysis in Python | Inspect, Clean, and Validate a Dataset. We will be practicing EDA by 
- Inspecting
- Cleaning
- Validating

a dataset using Python. This project will require `pandas` and `numpy`.

Description from Codecademy:
In this project, you'll imagine you are a data scientist interested in exploring data that looks at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients.

You will use your EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.
